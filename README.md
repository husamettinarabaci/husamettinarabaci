## 👨‍💻 About Me

Hi, I’m **Husamettin**, a software developer with **20+ years of experience** crafting technology solutions that bridge **hardware, software, and the human experience**.

From **microservices** and **IoT** to **cryptography**, **real-time communications**, and **electronic circuit design**, I’ve worn many hats in the tech world — and I’m still wearing them with pride.

These days though?  
🦀 **I’m all in on Rust.**

### ⚡ What I’m up to now

- 🌱 **Diving deep into Rust** — performance, safety, and joy in one language!
- 🔧 Contributing to **open-source** projects that make tools more useful and elegant.
- 🧪 Exploring **quantum computing** and **electromagnetic wave technologies** for next-gen healthcare.
- 🚀 Building [**hexaFn**](https://hexafn.com) — a growing initiative merging Rust, science, and software craftsmanship.

## 🦀 Why Rust?

I’ve worked with many languages (Go, C, Python...), but Rust?  
It **clicked**.  
It challenges you, rewards you, and makes you write **honest, fast, reliable code**.  
Every day I’m learning something new — and contributing back wherever I can.

📚 I believe **knowledge grows by sharing**, so I’m using GitHub to:
- ✍️ Share experiments
- 🛠 Build real-world tools
- 🤝 Collaborate with curious minds like you
