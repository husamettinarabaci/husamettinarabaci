## 🧬 Who Am I?

Hi, I'm **Husamettin**, a software developer with over **20 years of experience** designing and building systems where **software meets hardware** — and where ideas meet the real world.

These days, I'm focused on building high-performance, reliable, and safe software with **Rust**.  
🦀 I’m passionate about the language's fearless approach to systems programming, and it's now the **main driver** behind my work.

Before Rust, I spent over a decade writing production software in **Go**.  
🐹 I loved its simplicity, speed, and clean concurrency model — and it shaped how I approach scalable system design today.

Whether it’s **real-time communication**, **IoT**, **cryptography**, or **embedded systems**, I’ve architected and implemented systems that connect the abstract with the practical.

## 🦀 Rust & The Journey Ahead

Lately, I’ve fallen in love with **Rust**.

Its promise of **safety without compromise**, **zero-cost abstractions**, and **modern concurrency** is incredibly inspiring. I’m now using Rust for:

- ⚙️ Systems-level programming
- 📦 Reusable libraries and tooling
- 🧪 Scientific computing & signal processing
- 🤝 Open-source contributions
- 🧠 Pushing myself to grow every single day

Rust challenges me. And that’s what makes it awesome.

## 🚧 Featured Project: [hexaFn](https://github.com/hTuneSys/hexaFn)

> A programmable, event-driven function pipeline built entirely in **Rust**, based on the **6F Lifecycle Flow**:

### `Feed → Filter → Format → Function → Forward → Feedback`

🔗 **Website:** [hexafn.com](https://hexafn.com)

🧠 `hexaFn` is my flagship Rust project — a fully modular, extensible pipeline framework designed to experiment with event-driven and reactive systems at scale.

It merges:
- My background in **Go-based distributed systems**, and
- The performance and safety of modern **Rust programming**

Use it to build:
- ✨ Reactive function chains
- 🧩 Modular micro-pipelines
- 🔬 High-performance processing flows for **health-tech**, **data transformation**, and **signal processing**

> Built in Rust. Designed for extensibility. Open to collaboration.

## 🧠 Trivia & Passions

- 🧑‍🏫 I’ve mentored dozens of developers and still do
- 💡 I thrive on turning complex problems into simple systems
- 🔬 Deeply interested in **quantum computing**, **electromagnetic wave theory**, and **applied healthcare tech**
- 🛠 I still build things the hard way – just smarter each time
