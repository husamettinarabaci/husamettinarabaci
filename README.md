## 🧬 Who Am I?

Hi, I'm **Husamettin**, a software developer with over **20 years of experience** designing and building systems where **software meets hardware** — and where ideas meet the real world.

I’ve architected systems from low-level socket layers to cloud-scale microservices. Whether it’s **real-time communication**, **IoT**, **cryptography**, or **embedded design**, I’ve probably built something for it.

And for the past **10+ years**, my main tool of choice was **Go**.  
🐹 I love its simplicity, power, and pragmatic design.  
It’s my second brain for writing clean, reliable services.

## 🦀 Rust & The Journey Ahead

Lately, I’ve fallen in love with **Rust**.

Its promise of **safety without compromise**, **zero-cost abstractions**, and **modern concurrency** is incredibly inspiring. I’m now using Rust for:

- ⚙️ Systems-level programming
- 📦 Reusable libraries and tooling
- 🧪 Scientific computing & signal processing
- 🤝 Open-source contributions
- 🧠 Pushing myself to grow every single day

Rust challenges me. And that’s what makes it awesome.

## 🚧 Featured Project: [hexaFn](https://github.com/hTuneSys/hexaFn)

> A programmable, event-driven function pipeline built on the **6F Lifecycle Flow**:

### `Feed → Filter → Format → Function → Forward → Feedback`

🔗 **Website:** [hexafn.com](https://hexafn.com)

🧠 `hexaFn` blends my Go background in scalable system design with Rust’s performance & type safety — and it’s just getting started.

Use it to build:
- ✨ Reactive function chains
- 🧩 Modular micro-pipelines
- 🧠 Experimental computing flows for health-tech & R&D

Contributions welcome. Feedback loved. Innovation expected.

## 🧠 Trivia & Passions

- 🧑‍🏫 I’ve mentored dozens of developers and still do
- 💡 I thrive on turning complex problems into simple systems
- 🔬 Deeply interested in **quantum computing**, **electromagnetic wave theory**, and **applied healthcare tech**
- 🛠 I still build things the hard way – just smarter each time
